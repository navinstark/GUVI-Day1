            <ul>
                <li>It works on the binary protocol.
                </li>
                <li>It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
                </li>
                <li>It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
                </li>
                <li>It uses HPACK for data compression.

                    <h3>1.Request:</h3> Client sends a request for each resource over a separate TCP connection.
                   
                    <h3>2.Processing:</h3> Server processes requests sequentially and sends responses back over the same connection.
                   
                        <h3>3.Resource Retrieval:</h3> Client parses HTML for additional resources and initiates separate requests for each.

                    <h3>2.Processing:</h3> Server processes requests concurrently, utilizing multiplexing.
                   
                        <h3>3.Resource Retrieval:</h3> Client receives responses in parallel, benefiting from header compression and server push for optimal resource delivery.

            <h1 class="conclu">Conclusion</h1> 
            <p>HTTP/2 offers several enhancements over HTTP/1.1, including multiplexing, header compression, and server push, which collectively improve performance, reduce latency, and enhance the user experience. By optimizing resource delivery and communication between clients and servers, HTTP/2 aims to address the limitations of its predecessor and support the evolving needs of modern web applications.
